// The node stream controller is responsible for the situation where a number of
// streams are managed by registering them by their ID and suspending their tasks,
// until one stream indicates it has been selected.
//
// Upon selection, every remaining (and future) stream resumes by throwing
// `CancellationError`. The selected stream remains suspended until its Task
// is cancelled, at which point it resumes (without throwing).
//
// To that last point, the cancellation of a task that is suspended via register
// results in one of the following.
//  a) as we've seen, if the register was for the stream that was selected, then
//     the task resumes without throwing.
//  b) if no stream has been selected, then the task resumes without throwing and
//     is forgotten
//  c) the situation where a stream has been selected but the cancel was for a
//     different stream is impossible, since the selection will have resumed the
//     the other streams by throwing `CancellationError` first.

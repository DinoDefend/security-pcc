//  SplunkloggingdConfigWriter.swift
//  SplunkloggingdConfigWriter
//
//  Created by Marco Magdy on 03/05/2024
//
// The config writer generates the config file which is used by splunkloggingd.
//
// The config writer first uses CFPrefs to retrieve the preferences
// It stores these in the file at the given output path.
//
// The file contains the predicates which are used by splunkloggingd
// for filtering log messages.
//
// The config writer then subscribes to any changes to the predicates
// using FastConfig. If there is any update in the predicates, it
// overrides the predicates in the output file with the latest ones
// received from FastConfig.
//
// If the FastConfig property is subsequently removed, the config
// writer will revert back to the CFPrefs predicates.
